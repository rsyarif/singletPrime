v0 : calculates only upto cut5 and only calculates TpTH750 and TpJTH750.

v1 : calculates up to cut6 and all mass points of TpJTH.

v2 : added makeGraph() to plot efficiencies and compTHandJTH()

v3 : add ttbar background efficiency in graph in makeGraph() and graphRatio() eff_signal/eff_bkg ratio

v4 : update compTHandJTH() for relative cuts

v5 : erased eff_s/eff_b, instead implemented S/B, S/sqrt(B), S/sqrt(S+B) calculations and plots. Can definitely be cleaned up.

current : add S/sqrt(S + B + deltaB).
